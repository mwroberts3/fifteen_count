ideal points breakdown:
checking cards - 30%
sacrifice - 25%
jackpot - 25%
time - 20%

count round:
-eached checked card worth 10
    -if same color *1.25
    -speed bonus is applied after cards are checked and submitted
    -to be granted the speed bonus cards must be submitted within six seconds
        0 - 3 seconds = 39% bonus
        3 - 6 seconds = 24% bonus

        -looks like speed bonus gets nullified if a card was just swapped

    -time is still ticking even when game is paused


combo round: 
    -face value of the checked card * the previously checked and sacrificed cards
        -if same color as previously checked and sacrificed cards then value of sacrificed card is multiplied by 2
            -sacrificing a card that is not the same color as previous cards erases this point bonus for subsequently sacrificed cards

full clear (indigo loop):
    -35 seconds is added to timer upon first full clear and than 5 seconds fewer are added for each subsequent full clear (35, 30, 25, 20)
        -so, after 7 bonuses a full-hand play no longer adds any extra time

    -full clear adds a second back to the secondBonus pot?
        -maybe the thought is a full-clear shouldn't count against the seconds bonus

    -if all 10 cards are played in hand, fullhand seconds bonus is reset to 35

jackpot: 
    -sucessfully playing a jackpot card with SAME COLORS raise jackpot level by 2
        -playing with DIFFERENT COLORS raise jackpot level by 1
    
    -not playing jackpot card when it appears, jackpot level goes down 2

    -first play of jackpot doesn't count for anything

    -jackpot total (from cards played) is reduced by half if a jackpot card isn't played
    -the amount of points added DOES NOT include the cards being played at that point in time, that include the jackpot card

points breakdown:
    -after a round of arcade mode several factors make up the total amount of points
        -speed and time points are combined for a total time points
        -the time bonus consists of adding together all the speed bonuses during the course of a run and adding that to the total amount of added seconds
