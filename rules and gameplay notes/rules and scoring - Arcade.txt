ideal points breakdown:
checking cards - 30%
sacrifice - 25%
jackpot - 25%
time - 20%

count round:
-eached checked card worth 10
    -if same color *1.25
    -speed bonus is applied after cards are checked and submitted
    -to be granted the speed bonus cards must be submitted within six seconds
        0 - 3 seconds = 39% bonus
        3 - 6 seconds = 24% bonus

        -looks like speed bonus gets nullified if a card was just swapped

    -time is still ticking even when game is paused


combo round: 
    -face value of the checked card * the previously checked and sacrificed cards
        -if same color as previously checked and sacrificed cards then value of sacrificed card is multiplied by 2
            -sacrificing a card that is not the same color as previous cards erases this point bonus for subsequently sacrificed cards
    -sacrificing a card will add 3 seconds back to the halfhand bonus time gauge

Indigo Loops:
    -35 seconds is added to timer upon first full clear and than 5 seconds fewer are added for each subsequent full clear (35, 30, 25, 20)
        -so, after 7 bonuses a full-hand play no longer adds any extra time

    -full clear adds a second back to the secondBonus pot?
        -maybe the thought is a full-clear shouldn't count against the seconds bonus

    -if all 10 cards are played in hand, fullhand seconds bonus is reset to 35

jackpot: 
    -sucessfully playing a jackpot card with SAME COLORS raise jackpot level by 2
        -playing with DIFFERENT COLORS raise jackpot level by 1
    
    -not checking, (or swapping) jackpot card when it appears cause the jackpot level to go down based on the following formula:
        -Math.floor(numberOfCardsInHand / 2)

    -jackpot total (# of cards played) is reduced by half if a jackpot card isn't played.

    -the amount of points added DOES NOT include the cards being played at that point in time, that include the jackpot card

points breakdown:
    -after a round of arcade mode several factors make up the total amount of points
    -speed and time points are combined for a total time points
    -the time bonus is the total amount of speed bonuses plus the total amount of seconds added through half-hands and indigo loops
