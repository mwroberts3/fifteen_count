Bugs:
-7/6/21 - classic mode background switch seems to run a little slow the first few times switching to combo stage...need to see how it goes in the production version

-6/19/21 - sometimes jackpot is supposed to show up after swap but doesn't, reduces jackpot level by 1 (maybe make this a gameplay element)

-custom cursor stays stuck in place when clicking and dragging styled scrollbar

-11/28/21 - custom cursor blocking mouse and preventing clicks when testing on work laptop

-12/12 - it seems like sometimes users steam creds will be randomly deleted from local storage
