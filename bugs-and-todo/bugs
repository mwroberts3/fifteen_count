Bugs:
    -4/26/21 - when closing the "How To Play" Arcade section that happens the first time you enter the mode, should be a smoother transition, just using location.reload() now, which causes a janky flicker
    
    -4/22/21 - the click boxes to change subsection in settings in off

    -4/19/21 - played for the first time in a few months, scored about 8000 but JACKPOT POINTS WEREN'T COUNTED 
        -also jackpot points should maybe be worth more 
   
    -pause screen should show name of button if it's a custom key

    -shouldn't be able to submit score if there isn't a name

    -if it's on steam, maybe should just use steam account name for highscore
    
    -shouldn't be able to use a single key for more than one button
    
    -text gets cut off in action button visual display if text is too long, for example if action button is controlLeft 
    
    -should probably have any custom fonts downloaded and available locally
    
    -action button locks when on the select combo screen if press alt key once and then try to push shift to submit combo
    
    -sometimes when time is up the countdown will still tic down to -1 or 
    -2, should just have text in container be blank when timer reaches 0

    -container size is a little janky, make sure that is consistent

    -pause button not working properly, sometimes it still counts down when paused 

    -the selected theme should be saved, and not reset to classic when going back into window in settings menu

    -for some reason you can combo jokers again

    -in the theme select menu, if you click the space between the options it deselects all

    -when new highscore screen pops up, maybe the rest of the screen should fade out

    -shouldn't be able to keep pressing swap card button after timer runs out

    -if the card to be swapped has an earlier one in the hand, the first of type gets swapped

    -for some reason can open another window if holding control and click restart

    -if you play more than 1000 cards, gets too close to the cards icon

    -need to add exit button to the title screen

    -sometimes timer jumps to 0 if even with a couple seconds left...

    -swapping cards should subtract from total seconds

    -unchecking cards that were a 15 count and then submitting shouldn't work

    -score review gets skipped if the score is not within top scores

    -border animation after fullclear should return to theme's original border color, not working in cosmos 

    -if play through arcade mode and score isn't in top 50? then it just automatically restarts

    -can still get a gameover screen if game is paused but seconds timer keeps going
