Bugs:
-7/6/21 - classic mode background switch seems to run a little slow the first few times switching to combo stage...need to see how it goes in the production version

    -6/27/21 - need to balance the SFX level and BGM levels

    -6/27/21 - possible to add transition when switch gui color to combo background

    -6/20/21 - if swapping cards and time gets down to ~6 then time will still show up as red on timer, should only turn red when 5 or less

    -6/19/21 - sometimes jackpot is supposed to show up after swap but doesn't, reduces jackpot level by 1 (maybe make this a gameplay element)

    -6/19/21 - border animation for full clear on classic mode doesn't work, probably because of the shifting border color animation

    -6/18/21 - shouldn't have decimals as part of score, like getting with edited checked cards scoring

    -5/29/21 - scoring a jackpot bonus should have a sound effect

    -5/2/21 - should be a sound effect when the 15 count is reached

    -4/26/21 - when closing the "How To Play" Arcade section that happens the first time you enter the mode, should be a smoother transition, just using location.reload() now, which causes a janky flicker

    -4/22/21 - the click boxes to change subsection in settings in off

    -shouldn't be able to submit score if there isn't a name

    -if it's on steam, maybe should just use steam account name for highscore

    -text gets cut off in action button visual display if text is too long, for example if action button is controlLeft

    -should probably have any custom fonts downloaded and available locally

    -action button locks when on the select combo screen if press alt key once and then try to push shift to submit combo

    -sometimes when time is up the countdown will still tic down to -1 or
    -2, should just have text in container be blank when timer reaches 0

    -container size is a little janky, make sure that is consistent

    -pause button not working properly, sometimes it still counts down when paused

    -the selected theme should be saved, and not reset to classic when going back into window in settings menu

    -for some reason you can combo jokers again

    -in the theme select menu, if you click the space between the options it deselects all

    -when new highscore screen pops up, maybe the rest of the screen should fade out

    -shouldn't be able to keep pressing swap card button after timer runs out

    -if the card to be swapped has an earlier one in the hand, the first of type gets swapped

    -for some reason can open another window if holding control and click restart

    -if you play more than 1000 cards, gets too close to the cards icon

    -score review gets skipped if the score is not within top scores

    -if play through arcade mode and score isn't in top 50? then it just automatically restarts

    -can still get a gameover screen if game is paused but seconds timer keeps going?

    -custom cursor stays stuck in place when clicking and dragging styled scrollbar
