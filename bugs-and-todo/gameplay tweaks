Gameplay Tweaks:
-maybe do a total time played in the socre review, convert total seconds to minutes

-player should be alerted if they unlock a new theme

-should probably a colorblind mode

-maybe have an unlockable chaos mode where the 15 count changes to a different number -- or does something like 'at least 20', or 'less than 10'
