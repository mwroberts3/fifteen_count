Gameplay Tweaks:
-maybe change jackpot rules. playing the jackpot period, regardless of color will add another level, if it's same color, then add 2 levels. NO MAX ON HOW HIGH THE JACKPOT GOES!!!
    -if a jackpot card goes unplayed maybe cut jackpot level in half

-player should be alerted if they unlock a new theme

-should probably a colorblind mode

-maybe have an unlockable chaos mode where the 15 count changes to a different number -- or does something like 'at least 20', or 'less than 10'
