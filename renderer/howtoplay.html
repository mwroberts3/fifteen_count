            <p>
              Arcade is the primary mode of Indigo Loop. The goal of Arcade mode
              is to score as many points as possible before time runs out. To
              start, the player is presented with 10 cards of two differents
              colors and 60 seconds on the clock; more time can be added during
              play. There are multiple ways to score points, across two unique
              gameplay phases. Making plays with cards of the same color almost
              always results in more points.
            </p>
            <h4>Phases</h4>
            <p>
              There are two distinct gameplay phases in Arcade mode. The
              <strong>Count!</strong> and <strong>Combo!</strong> phases. The
              Combo! phase immediately follows the Count! phase. Points can be
              scored in either.
            </p>
            <section id="how-to-phases">
              <div>
                <h4 class="minor-how-to-header">Count!</h4>
                <p>
                  At the start of a game, players are presented with 10 cards in
                  one of two colors with values ranging from -1 to 15. The
                  player can click on any of the cards shown to
                  <em>count</em> it. Multiple cards can be counted at any time
                  and the total sum of their values is shown in the translucent,
                  rounded container in the center of the bottom portion of the
                  player’s interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong
                    >The goal of the Count! phase is to count any number of
                    cards whose values add up to 15</strong
                  >. Once a 15 count is reached the player can submit the
                  counted cards and move on to the Combo! phase.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  The player also has the option to <em>swap</em> the last card
                  in their hand for a new one. They can either press the swap
                  button or click the button in the player’s interface. Time is
                  subtracted from the countdown timer when a card is swapped, so
                  use this option carefully.
                </p>
                <h4 class="minor-how-to-header">Combo!</h4>
                <p>
                  In the Combo! phase players can choose to sacrifice cards to
                  rack up combo points. Beware though, a card that is combo'd
                  will be removed from your hand, at least temporarily.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Strategically choosing when to combo card, and clicking them
                  in the most rewarding sequence, will result in big point
                  gains.

              There are three main types of cards: cards with a single value,
              compound cards with two values and cards with a -1 value. These
              values have to be carefully considered during the Count! phase, as
              the player's goal is to click on cards whose values add up to 15.
              There is also a modified card, the jackpot card.

                <h4 class="minor-how-to-header">Compound</h4>
                <p>
                  Compound cards have two values, and allow the player choose
                  which value to use. The player chooses the value by pressing
                  the corresponding key or by clicking value displayed in the
                  interface.

                <h4 class="minor-how-to-header">Jackpot</h4>
                <p>
                  During the course of a game, random cards will be selected as
                  jackpot cards. Try to count and play the jackpot card when it
                  appears to rack up points and raise the jackpot level. The
                  amount of points added depends on the current jackpot level
                  and the total number of cards played up to that point.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jackpot cards are indicated by a color changing border and a
                  notification above the game board.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The jackpot level will change during the course of a game.
                  Skilled players should be able to consistently keep it at a
                  high level.

                <p>
                  Extra time can be added to the countdown timer if a player
                  plays at least half of the cards in their hand during the
                  Count! phase. Strategically counting cards to add extra time
                  is essential to racking up good high scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The amount of time added depends on the current level of the
                  bonus meter, which is shown underneath the countdown timer
                  display. The bonus meter is replenished by sacrificing cards
                  in the Combo! phase.

                <p>
                  If a player successfully counts and plays all the cards in
                  their hand, they’ll complete an Indigo Loop and
                  <strong>all ten cards will be replenished.</strong> They will
                  also get additional seconds added to the countdown timer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In other words, if a player recognizes that the value of all
                  the cards in their hand adds up to 15, they can play them all
                  and replinish the previously sacrificed cards.

              Time attack has a set time limit of 180 seconds. Unlike Arcade
              mode, there is no way to add more seconds to the timer. The player
              is presented with 18 cards of two colors and random values at the
              start of play. Like Arcade mode, the player needs to click cards
              to <em>count</em> them and have their values add up to 15. The
              cards are automatically submitted once a 15-count is reached.

                  to 12. Counting cards of the same color will result in more
                  points. Additionally, there are two specialty cards: the
                  <strong>Bonus</strong> and <strong>Shuffle</strong> cards.
