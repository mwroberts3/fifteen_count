              <strong>Tip:</strong> the best way to enjoy the Arcade mode is to
              play with only two general rules in mind, and then learn the other
              rules as you play.
              <em>Card values must add up to 15 to submit</em>,
              <em
                >checking card or comboing cards that are the same color results
                in more points.</em
              >
            </p>
            <h4>Phases</h4>
            <p>
              There are two phases of play that make up the core of the gameplay
              loop in Arcade Mode. The
              <strong>Count!</strong> phase involves tapping cards and trying to
              get a total that adds up to 15. The <strong>Combo!</strong> phase
              immediately follows and lets players sacrifice cards in order
              score points <em>and</em> shrink their hand.
            </p>
            <h4>Scoring Points</h4>
            <p>
              Pretty much every aspect of gameplay can result in more points.
              The bulk of points will generally be scored by checking cards in
              the Count! phase. Additional points can be scored in Combo! phase.
              Successfully playing the jackpot can also result in large points
              gains.
            </p>
            <h4>Adding Time</h4>
            <p>
              Time management is paramount to having a successful run. Time can
              be added through particular acheivements: checking at least half
              the cards in a players hand or checking all cards in a players
              hand.
            </p>
            <h4>Restoring Cards</h4>
            <p>
              A player can reset to a fullhand of 10 cards if they successfully
              check all the cards in their hand, which can only happen if the
              respective card values of each card adds up to 15.
