              Arcade mode games can last anywhere from 100 seconds to 20 minutes
              or more, depending on the players skill level and knowledge of the
              game.
            </p>
            <h4>Phases</h4>
            <p>
              There are two phases of play that make up the core of the gameplay
              loop in Arcade Mode. The
              <strong>Count!</strong> phase involves tapping cards and trying to
              get a total that adds up to 15. The <strong>Combo!</strong> phase
              immediately follows and lets players sacrifice cards in order
              score points <em>and</em> shrink their hand.
            </p>
            <h4>Scoring Points</h4>
            <p>
              Pretty much every aspect of gameplay can result in more points.
              The bulk of points will generally be scored by checking cards in
              the Count! phase. Additional points can be scored in Combo! phase.
              Successfully playing the jackpot can also result in large points
              gains.
            </p>
            <div class="how-to-tip-container">
              <strong>Tip&nbsp;-</strong> the best way to enjoy the Arcade mode
              is to play with only two general rules in mind:
              <li><em>card values must add up to 15 to submit</em></li>
              <li>
                <em
                  >checking or comboing cards that are the same color results in
                  more points.</em
                >
              </li>
            </div>
            <h4>Adding Time</h4>
            <p>
              Time management is paramount to having a successful run. Time can
              be added through particular acheivements: checking at least half
              the cards in a players hand or checking all cards in a players
              hand.
            </p>
            <h4>Restoring Cards</h4>
            <p>
              A player can reset to a fullhand of 10 cards if they successfully
              check all the cards in their hand, which can only happen if the
              respective card values of each card adds up to 15.

        <!-- Time Attack - How to Play -->
        <section id="ta-how-to-instructions" class="hidden">
          <div class="how-to-play-section">
            <h2 class="sub-topic-header">Time Attack</h2>
            <p>
              In Time Attack players have 180 seconds to score as many points as
              possible. They are presented a mix of 18 red and black cards with
              values of -1 to 12. Like Arcade mode the foundation of gameplay
              consists of players clicking on cards and adding up their numbers
              to 15.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike Arcade mode, players do not have to have to submit cards
              after a total of 15 is reached; the cards are automatically
              submitted.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Cards</h4>
            <p>
              There are three types of cards in Time Attack. All types of cards
              are based on the Standard Card.
              <li>
                <strong>Standard Card</strong> - the standard card is either
                black or red
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bomb Card</strong> - as a Time Attack game progresses
                standard card become bomb cards. This is indicated by a bomb
                icon in the top corner of the card. If bomb cards are included
                as part of a 15 count sumbit. The the current cards are scrapped
                and replaced by an entirely new hand of 18 cards
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bonus Card</strong> - when a time attack game starts the
                card in the first position, (top left corner), is the designated
                bonus card. This is indicated by a colorful, animated border
              </li>
            </p>
            <h4>Utilizing the Bonus Card</h4>
            <p>
              Correctly using the bonus card can separate a decent Time Attack
              score and a great Time Attack Score. At the start of a game, the
              bonus card starts in the top left corner of the player's hand. As
              a player submits 15 counts from the center of the hand. The bonus
              card will make its way across and down the board as new cards
              replace the played ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the bonus card makes it to final position in the bottom right
              position of the player's hand, its score enhancing power is
              unlocked. You can now submit the bonus card in a regular submit to
              apply a points multiplier to the score of the cards just played.
