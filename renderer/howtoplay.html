              Arcade is the main mode in Indigo Loop, and individual games can
              last anywhere from about 2 to 20 minutes for experienced players.
              The are several nuances to this mode, the mastery and
              understanding of which can separate an average and good score.
            </p>
            <h4>Phases</h4>
            <p>
              There are two phases of play that make up the core of the gameplay
              loop in Arcade Mode. The
              <strong>Count!</strong> phase involves tapping cards and trying to
              get a total that adds up to 15. The <strong>Combo!</strong> phase
              immediately follows, and lets players sacrifice cards in order
              score points <em>and</em> shrink their hand.
            </p>
            <div class="how-to-img-container" id="arcade-howto-vid-1">
              <img
                class="static-vid"
                src="img/arcade-howto-vid-1-static.png"
                style="width: 400px; height: 300px"
              />
            </div>
            <h4>Scoring Points</h4>
            <p>
              The best way to enjoy the Arcade mode is to play with only two
              general rules in mind:
              <li><em>card values must add up to 15 to submit</em></li>
              <li>
                <em
                  >checking or comboing cards that are the same color results in
                  more points</em
                >
              </li>
            </p>
            <div class="how-to-img-container">
              <img
                src="img/arcade-howto-pic1.png"
                style="width: 400px; height: 300px"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Pretty much every aspect of gameplay can result in more points.
              The bulk of points will generally be scored by checking cards in
              the Count! phase. Additional points can be scored in Combo! phase.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Jackpot Cards</h4>
              During the course of a game, random cards will be selected as
              <strong>jackpot</strong> cards. Try to play the jackpot card when
              they appear to rack up bonus points, which are based on the total
              amount of cards played.
            </p>
            <p>Jackpot cards are indicated by a special golden border.</p>
            <h4>Adding Time</h4>
            <p>
              Through an adequate number of cards during the Count phase,
              players can add more time to the timer. The regular time bonus
              level is indicated by the bar of green blocks underneath the
              timer. Submitting cards during the Combo phase will replenish part
              of the time bonus.
            </p>
            <h4>Restoring Cards</h4>
            <p>
              Cards will be restored if player successfully checks and plays all of the cards in their hand, completing an indigo loop.

        <!-- Time Attack - How to Play -->
        <section id="ta-how-to-instructions" class="hidden">
          <div class="how-to-play-section">
            <h2 class="sub-topic-header">Time Attack</h2>
            <p>
              Time Attack is a less complex game mode than Arcade and is ideal
              for shorter play sessions, as rounds only last three minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of Time Attack is to play as many cards as possible
              within the 180 second timer, and unlike Arcade mode
              <em
                ><strong
                  >there is no way to add more seconds to the clock</strong
                ></em
              >. So all you have is 180 seconds. Make them count!
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Arcade mode, you'll want to click cards and have their values
              add up to 15. A key difference is that
              <em
                ><strong
                  >once 15 is reached, the cards are automatically
                  submitted.</strong
                ></em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Cards come in a mix of two colors, with values of -1 to 12. Assume
              that playing cards of the same color will result in more points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, there are two types of special cards.
              <strong>Bonus</strong> and <strong>Shuffle</strong> cards. The
              Bonus card starts in the first position at the start of each
              round. You should try to get the bonus card in the final position,
              by submitting 15 count pairs in between the start and end.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                <strong>
                  A Bonus card played from the final position will result in
                  maximum points.
                </strong>
              </em>
            </p>
            <div class="how-to-img-container">
              <img
                src="img/time-attack-howto-pic1.png"
                style="width: 400px; height: 300px"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              A Shuffle card appears on a random card, and if this card is
              played, your entire hand will be redealt and the Bonus card will
              be reset to the first position. These cards can sometimes be used
              strategically.
