            Fifteen Count is a fast paced puzzle card game, where the goal is to
            get as many points as possible.

          <p>
            In Arcade mode play is broken down into two Rounds. The "Count
            Round" and the "Combo Round"
          </p>
          <p>
            The "Count Round" asks players to check(click on) any number of
            cards, as long as their values add up to 15.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "Combo Round" gives players the option of 'sacrificing' cards
            for additional points. Though player's hand's card count will
            permanantly <em>lose</em> the number of cards played in the combo
            round from their hand's maximum number of cards. For example, if you
            start out with ten cards and then play one in the Combo Round, the
            maximum number of cards you can have in your hand--going
            forward--will be nine. So, the Combo Round is great for adding to
            point totals, if used strategically.
