              Arcade is the primary mode of Indigo Loop, and the duration of each round is open ended. The player starts with 100 seconds, but this can be manipulated during play. The goal of each round of Arcade is to score as many points as possible. There are multiple ways to score points, across two unique gameplay phases.
            </p>
            <h4>Phases</h4>
            <p>
              There are two phases of play that make up the core of the gameplay loop in Arcade Mode. The <strong>Count!</strong> phase involves tapping cards and trying to get a total that adds up to 15. The <strong>Combo!</strong> phase immediately follows, and lets players sacrifice cards in order to score points <em>and</em> shrink their hand.
            </p>

              <img
                class="static-vid"
                src="img/how-to-images/arcade-howto-vid-1-static.png"
              />
            </div>
            <h4>Count!</h4>
            <p>
              The bulk of a scoring will come from checking cards during the count phase. Checking cards of the same color will result in more points.
            </p>
            <p>
                The player also has the option to swap the last card in their hand for a new one. They can either press the swap button or click the button on the player’s hud. Time is subtracted from the countdown when a card is swapped, so it must be used strategically to keep a good run going. The time subtracted can change based on the current amount of cards in a player’s hand.

              </div>
            </p>
            <h4>Combo!</h4>
            <p>
              In the combo round players can choose to sacrifice cards and rack up combo points. Beware though, a card comboed in this phase will be removed from their hand.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Jackpot Cards</h4>
              During the course of a game, random cards will be selected as jackpot cards. Try to check and play the jackpot card when they appear to rack up more points. The amount of points added depends on the current jackpot level and the number of cards played throughout the game up to that point.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Jackpot cards are indicated by a color changing border.</p>
            <h4>Adding Time</h4>
            <p>
              Extra time can be added to the countdown timer if players check and play at least half of the cards in their hand. Strategically checking cards to add extra time can greatly lengthen a round of Arcade and in turn result in a higher score.
            </p>
            <h4>Indigo Loops</h4>
            <p>
              All 10 cards will be replaced and a time bonus will be added if a player checks and plays all the cards currently in their hand.

        <!-- Time Attack - How to Play -->
        <section id="ta-how-to-instructions" class="hidden">
          <div class="how-to-play-section">
            <h2 class="sub-topic-header">Time Attack</h2>
            <p>
              Time Attack is a less complex game mode than Arcade and is ideal
              for shorter play sessions, as rounds only last three minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of Time Attack is to play as many cards as possible
              within the 180 second timer, and unlike Arcade mode
              <em
                ><strong
                  >there is no way to add more seconds to the clock</strong
                ></em
              >. So all you have is 180 seconds. Make them count!
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Arcade mode, you'll want to click cards and have their values
              add up to 15. A key difference is that
              <em
                ><strong
                  >once 15 is reached, the cards are automatically
                  submitted.</strong
                ></em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Cards come in a mix of two colors, with values of -1 to 12. Assume
              that playing cards of the same color will result in more points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, there are two types of special cards.
              <strong>Bonus</strong> and <strong>Shuffle</strong> cards. The
              Bonus card starts in the first position at the start of each
              round. You should try to get the bonus card in the final position,
              by submitting 15 count pairs in between the start and end.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                <strong>
                  A Bonus card played from the final position will result in
                  maximum points.
                </strong>
              </em>
            </p>
            <div class="how-to-img-container">
              <img
                src="img/how-to-images/time-attack-howto-pic1.png"
                style="width: 400px; height: 300px"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              A Shuffle card appears on a random card, and if this card is
              played, your entire hand will be redealt and the Bonus card will
              be reset to the first position. These cards can sometimes be used
              strategically.
