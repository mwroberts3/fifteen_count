Bugs:
    -pause screen should show name of button if it's a custom key

    -links shouldn't be draggable on title screen

    -shouldn't be able to submit score if there isn't a name

    -if it's on steam, maybe should just use steam account name for highscore
    
    -shouldn't be able to use a single key for more than one button
    
    -get around the pause-resume click delay, but maybe should add transition that lasts 900 milliseconds
    
    -text gets cut off in action button visual display if text is too long, for example if action button is controlLeft 
    
    -should probably have any custom fonts downloaded and available locally
    
    -action button locks when on the select combo screen if press alt key once and then try to push shift to submit combo
    
    -sometimes when time is up the countdown will still tic down to -1 or 
    -2, should just have text in container be blank when timer reaches 0

    -container size is a little janky, make sure that is consistent

    -pause button not working properly, sometimes it still counts down when paused 

    -the selected theme should be saved, and not reset to classic when going back into window in settings menu

    -for some reason you can combo jokers again

Gameplay Tweaks:
    -should probably a colorblind mode

    -swap penalty should go up the less cards you have in your hand
    10 - 6 : -3 seconds
    5 : -4 seconds
    4 : -5 seconds
    3 : -6 seconds
    2 : -8 seconds 

Sound and Skin Options for arcade:
    -3 different track/skin Options (similar to Lumines)
        1) classic
        2) jungle
        3) universe
    -option to turn sound fxs on/off
    -maybe have jungle and universe as unlockables

Time Attack Mode:
    -same skin and sound effects as classic, different music
    -get 10 - 20 cards
    -have 7 seconds to use the most cards possible to get to 15
    -20 rounds
    -should have a way to compound, so if you play a good combo, you have more cards to choose from in the next round
