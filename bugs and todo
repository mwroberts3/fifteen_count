Bugs:
    -pause screen should show name of button if it's a custom key

    -shouldn't be able to submit score if there isn't a name

    -if it's on steam, maybe should just use steam account name for highscore
    
    -shouldn't be able to use a single key for more than one button
    
    -text gets cut off in action button visual display if text is too long, for example if action button is controlLeft 
    
    -should probably have any custom fonts downloaded and available locally
    
    -action button locks when on the select combo screen if press alt key once and then try to push shift to submit combo
    
    -sometimes when time is up the countdown will still tic down to -1 or 
    -2, should just have text in container be blank when timer reaches 0

    -container size is a little janky, make sure that is consistent

    -pause button not working properly, sometimes it still counts down when paused 

    -the selected theme should be saved, and not reset to classic when going back into window in settings menu

    -for some reason you can combo jokers again

    -in the theme select menu, if you click the space between the options it deselects all

    -when new highscore screen pops up, maybe the rest of the screen should fade out

    -shouldn't be able to keep pressing swap card button after timer runs out

    -if the card to be swapped has an earlier one in the hand, the first of type gets swapped

    -for some reason can open another window if holding control and click restart

    -if you play more than 1000 cards, gets too close to the cards icon

    -need to add exit button to the title screen

    -sometimes timer jumps to 0 if even with a couple seconds left...

    -swapping cards should subtract from total seconds

    -unchecking cards that were a 15 count and then submitting shouldn't work

    -score review gets skipped if the score is not within top scores

    -border animation after fullclear should return to theme's original border color, not working in cosmos 

Gameplay Tweaks:
-player should be alerted if they unlock a new theme

-should probably a colorblind mode

-maybe have an unlockable chaos mode where the 15 count changes to a different number -- or does something like 'at least 20', or 'less than 10'

UI Tweaks:
-buttons in player's hand needs some kind of animation when clicked

Time Attack Mode:
    -same skin and sound effects as classic, different music
    -get 10 - 20 cards
    -have 7 seconds to use the most cards possible to get to 15
    -20 rounds
    -should have a way to compound, so if you play a good combo, you have more cards to choose from in the next round



TIME ATTACK BUGS:
-if go over 15 then go back down, it should trigger the card redeal
