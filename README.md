**_FIFTEEN COUNT_**
https://github.com/cardmeister/cardmeister.github.io

things to fix as of 9/19/20:
-SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SWAP CARDS WHEN ONE CARD LEFT IN HAND

-possible to have mouse scroll from one edge to the oposite side, ala pacman?

-animate the total score as points are being added up

-don't have eventlistener on each individual card, but have event delgation on the containing div (SEE TODO LIST PROJECT). This should give game better performance

-bonus points still being applied even though count isn't 15

-some sort of highscore window should still pop up, even if not connected to the internet...right now it skips the highscore window if not connected

-still occasionally noticing a weird swap card glitch, where the wrong card is swapped, seems to happen around when a new deck is created

-shouldn't be able to uncheck all cards in the combo phase
-this is working correctly now, but using the ALT key is causing problems again

-pause actually not working?
