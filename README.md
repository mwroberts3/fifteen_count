**_FIFTEEN COUNT_**
https://github.com/cardmeister/cardmeister.github.io

things to fix as of 7/26/20:
-shouldn't be able to get rid of face cards when no value is selected, but fifteen count is still fifteen

-shouldn't be able to combo with jokers

-shouldn't be able to combo already checked cards in the combo phase, GAMEBREAKING BUG

-possible to have mouse scroll from one edge to the oposite side, ala pacman?

-checking more cards of the same suit, even when 15 count is 15, adds points to the points in play

-sometimes getting really low combo scores...notice this a lot with aces...
