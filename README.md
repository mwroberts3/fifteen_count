**_FIFTEEN COUNT_**
https://github.com/cardmeister/cardmeister.github.io

things to fix as of 7/26/20:
-shouldn't be able to get rid of face cards when no value is selected, but fifteen count is still fifteen

-combo numbers don't seem right

-shouldn't be able to combo with jokers

-combos on single aces not working

-shouldn't be able to combo already checked cards in the combo phase, GAMEBREAKING BUG

-there's about a 1 second delay when using the key method, either through js file or html element

-possible to have mouse scroll from one edge to the oposite side, ala pacman?
